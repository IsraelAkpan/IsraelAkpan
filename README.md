### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Israel. I enjoy reading physics texts and talking philosophy. I like to learn about new ideas and GitHub is my most recent pick. I like to collaborate with others and I'm looking forward to get in the mix of all that! Iâ€™m currently learning about brains, how to detect brain waves and use that information to model their underlying electrical activity and so I suppose that future projects will be in areas relating to MEG/EEG and Neuroscience as a whole.
